# Students vs Teachers:

## Tower Defense Simulator

### Base Idea:

- Students are the Towers
- Teachers are the balloons

### Description

A Tower Defense Simulator where the teachers will come in waves, with different strengths.

The students will shoot the teachers with guns.

The school canteen is the upgrade shop.

##### Towers:

- Year 9 (bad)
- Year 10
- Year 11
- Year 13
- Year 12
- Prefects
- Head Boy
- Top 6

##### Balloons:

- Relief Teachers
- Social Studies
- English Teachers
- Accounting Teachers
- Economics Teachers
- Science Teachers
- IT Teachers
- Math Teachers
- PE Teachers
- Mr Tucker most powerful (cannot destroy)

### Education Aspect

The educational aspect of my game is the inclusion of a quiz system.

When teachers spawn, some may be overcharged (indicated by a highlighted icon).

To disable this charge, the user can click on the teacher and a quiz will pop up.

Depending on the type of teacher, the quiz will occur.

For example, if you click on the math teacher, a quiz for "what 2x2=" will show up.

Each teacher type will have a different style questions, and there will be a bank of questions per teacher so that the questions are not repetitive.

##### Additional Comments:

Make it a 32x45 grid (32x32 pixels per grid square) = 1024x1440
